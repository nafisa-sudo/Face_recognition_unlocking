# Face_recognition_unlocking_with_hand_gesture
This project is about facial recognition where in a user is recognized by his/her face and if it matches with the data-set provided, the phone will unlock.
The acuracy of the project is given in terms of 'matched parameter' in green or red. 
If it doesn't match, the UI simply tells how similar your face is to the phone's owner and hence decides whether to unlock or not.

To get the hands on experience on OpenCV, I have also tried Hand - Gesture recoginition coming under the topic of Pattern recognition. 
Hand gesture prediction model conveys as to what sign it has been shown. 
Numbers like 1, 2 etc.. are decided by the model and given as the output as per the input.

The project is intended to work and implemented in a user interface in a user's phone. 

Language used - Python
Skills - OpenCv library
